## Individual Consultancy and Support

Leadership is a privileged position – it can be challenging, exhilarating and demanding in equal measure. Authentic and compassionate leaders bring their whole selves to work, they combine high expectations with a genuine desire to develop their teams. They are confident in their purpose and humble in their approach. If you’re a senior executive or an aspiring leader I can help you: be clear about what you are trying to achieve, structure your approach and get the best from those you work with. I have worked with, managed and coached senior leaders formally and informally for over 20 years and will bring: clarity, purpose and warmth to our relationship.

* Coaching
* Mentoring
* Non-Managerial Supervision

## Team Consultancy

This is where the change happens – the interface between the individual and the organisation. Building cultures of trust, respect and high performance is both essential and rewarding. Working with leadership teams to understand: their purpose, their capabilities, their opportunities and responsibilities should never be neglected. We have significant experience of working on a team and departmental levels – to change cultures and ground organisational strategies meaningfully at the points of service delivery.

* Culture change
* Performance
* Delivery

## Organisational Development

It has become almost a cliche that as Peter Drucker says ‘culture eats strategy for breakfast’ but a successful organisational always focuses on both in equal measure. How and why we do things is as important as what we do. In my career, I have led a Business Development function that was the most successful in the sector, built one of the largest health and social care charities in the UK and led 4 different merger exercises designed to broaden the organisation’s impact and reach. Working at Board and Leadership Team we can help you with:

* Business Development
* Strategic Development
* Change Management
* Crisis and Performance Management
* Marketing/Communications and Positioning

## Trusteeship
